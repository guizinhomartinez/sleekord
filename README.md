# Sleekord (aka Custom Discord Theme)
This Discord theme aims to make the Discord experience better, making the UI more modern and easy on the eyes. The theme is lightweight and beautiful. Alternatively, you can use the latest commit verison, as they are almost always stable and do not have problems.
Currently on the project, there are only two settings you can change blur-ammount and font-primary, you can change these by following the installation guide.

## Installation
Please refer to **[the website that I've made for everything relating to this project.](https://sleekord.vercel.app/)**
